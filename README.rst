Installation
============

Copy the plug-ins to the munin plugin directory, e.g ``/etc/munin/plugins/``.

Granting Permissions
====================

To use these plug-ins you have to tell munin-node to execute them as
root by changing the plug-in configuration file (on debian that is
``/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d``)::

    [rabbitmq-consumers]
    user root

    [rabbitmq-messages]
    user root

    [rabbitmq-messages_unacknowledged]
    user root

    [rabbitmq-messages_uncommitted]
    user root

    [rabbitmq-queue_memory]
    user root


Using a Custom Virtual Host
============================

You can set the name of virtual host by changing the plug-in configuration
file (on debian that is ``/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d``)::

    [rabbitmq-consumers]
    env.vhost vhostname

    [rabbitmq-messages]
    env.vhost vhostname

    [rabbitmq-messages_unacknowledged]
    env.vhost vhostname

    [rabbitmq-messages_uncommitted]
    env.vhost vhostname

    [rabbitmq-queue_memory]
    env.vhost vhostname

Setting a different RabbitMQctl path
====================================

You can set the path of the rabbitmqctl binary by changing the plug-in
configuration file (on debian that is ``/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d``)::

    [rabbitmq-*]
    env.rabbitmqctl /usr/local/sbin/rabbitmqctl
